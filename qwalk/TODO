Features: import mdl, md2, or md3; export mdl.

- Fix crash when exporting a model with no textures.
- Merge meshes with different textures.
- Fix byte swapping.

- Keep compressed MDL vertex coordinates, indices, etc. intact in the case of
  importing, processing & exporting an MDL (don't want any "drift", and don't
  want the vertices unnecessarily split up).
- Command for drawing wireframe lines on the skin.
- Allow importing alternate palettes for MDLs.
- Allow configuration of the fullbright rules when downsampling to the palette
  when exporting MDLs. Possibly just import the colormap, and tell it to ignore
  fullbrights.
- Write an MD3 writer.
- Do air-tight error checking to avoid all potential crashes (and detect all
  invalid data imported models).
- The viewer shouldn't use 100% CPU usage.
- Test exporting empty models (no vertices/triangles) to each format. Note in
  compatibility notes whether engines will be able to load empty models (or
  whether a 'null' model should instead be a single degenerate triangle).
- Modes to emulate certain engines' rendering exactly, including lighting,
  texture coordinate rounding, and crappy GLQuake texture resampling.
- Optional stencil shadows mode.
- Rewrite command-line argument parsing.
