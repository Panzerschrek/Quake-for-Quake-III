Server:

Client:
* Fix looping sounds for entites such elevators
* Addons (rogue/hipnotic) support in status bar
* Fix deathmatch scoreborad drawing code
* Entities/player interpolation/extrapolation (smooth movement, rotation, animation, rocket trails based on actual trajectory)

Menu UI:
* Video settings
* More additional settings
* Modal dialog while starting new game if already in game
* Multiplayer menu improvements
* Active game detection fixes
* Improved authors menu

Shaders:
* Shaders for in-game UI elements (avoid ugly interpolation and power of 2 textures conversion)

Data export:
* Support animated textures on exported BSP models
* Replace '*' in texture names (in maps, wad) with something else, because '*' is not a valid symbol for file names. Also Quake-utilities recognize '/*' as comment start.

Maps:
* Fix missing textures (mostly water)
* Fix invalid skies
* Fix water brushes - mark side brushes with "nodraw" shader.
