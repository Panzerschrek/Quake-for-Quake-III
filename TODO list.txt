* Multiplayer menu improvements

Shaders:
* Shaders for in-game UI elements (avoid ugly interpolation and power of 2 textures conversion)

Data export:
* Sprites
* BSP items models (health boxes, ammo boxes)
* Properly export frames of flame models (should export more than 1-2 frames)
* Replace '*' in texture names (in maps, wad) with something else, because '*' is not a valid symbol for file names. Also Quake-utilities recognize '/*' as comment start.

* Fix leaks on some original maps

* Fix invalid skies
* Fix water brushes - mark side brushes with "nodraw" shader.
